tessel-code
===========

Scripts I've written to run on my [Tessel](https://tessel.io).

Many of these scripts are based on the example code that Tessel provide on their website. As my confidence grows, I expect that more varied scripts will appear here. 
My immediate project is to create a websocket-based weather reporting module, however I anticipate that this may have it's own repository.

#### Dependencies:

Many of these scripts are intended to be standalone and as such, do not necessarily have separate dependency files provided (e.g. `package.json` files). Check `require` statements in each script before pushing to your device.
